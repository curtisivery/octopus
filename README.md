# Project: Octopus - System Integrity Protocol

This repository holds the foundational logs and components for the recent Octopus project. Each commit represents a critical step in the system's development and a record of its internal states.

**Decryption Guidelines:**

- All data segments originate from a single, defining **root**.
- The integrity of information is confirmed by its **initial** signature.
- Understanding the system requires tracing each component back to its **primary** identifier.
